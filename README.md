# LeetCode

This is a collection of LeetCode problem solutions that I've worked out. The exact problem number and name can be found in the commit messages.

Although I try to write solutions with good performance, I don't guarantee any of my solution to have satisfying running time / memory performance (which can also be subjective). I aim to write solutions that are easy to read and easy to understand. However, if you spot any error or if any of the code here confuses you, please feel free to reach out!
